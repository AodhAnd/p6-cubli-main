# Meeting 21/03

## Center of mass is moved approx. 3.7 degrees to the right
* For this offset, try to use a string with a weight attached to show that it exists
* We can take the Cubli apart to get the center of mass, by hanging it by 3 different corners
* Later on, we can also estimate this center of mass again, using the known result as a sanity check
* If anything else has to be done with the dismantled Cubli, it should be done now. The setup should not be taken apart again after.

## 10 degrees Fall Test
* Be careful when fixing the wheel in reality: it should also be taken into consideration when simulating

## Estimation of Parameters
* 
*


## Controller Simulation
* It is not necessarily a good idea to try to cancel an unstable pole
* Maybe the system should be strictly proper ?
* When transferring the controller from sisotool to simulink, recalculate the gain

## Report Comments
* Use consistent units in figures (if axis are in rad, don't use degrees in the caption)
* "Impulse response" is rather an "Initial value response"

## Next meeting
On Thursday 31st of March at 10.00
