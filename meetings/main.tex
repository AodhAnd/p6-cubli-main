\section*{Supervisor meeting\\ \small Wednesday, 20th of April 2016}

\subsection{Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] Problem formulation rather than requirements
  \item[-] Instead of setting random requirements we investigate how far the boundaries of control can be pushed while comparing different controller designs.
  \item[-] Of course a requirement of stabilization is still needed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Controller Design}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] Go to State Space
  \item[-] Afterwards go back and investigate the previous design methods: \si{y = \theta + k \omega} and Direct Design Method of Ragazzini (Coefficient Matching).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Bode Plots of Discretized Controller}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] The Tustin discretized controller has a \si{-360^\circ} offset in the closed loop plot.
  \item[-] No reason to show the closed loop plot.
  \item[-] One argument for Tustin with prewarp is that it has realizable poles.
  \item[-] Tustin with prewarp is also better than Tustin without prewarp on the open loop plot.
  \item[-] Phase range is better with Tustin with prewarp no matter what - choose Tustin with prewarp.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Next Supervisor Meeting}
Wednesday, 27th of April at 13.00
