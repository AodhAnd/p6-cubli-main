\section*{Supervisor meeting\\ \small Wednesday, 13th of April 2016}

\subsection{Testing and Sensors}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] Measure the actual voltage on the board around the filter to verify that the gain given by Simon is effectively 3.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Complementary Filter}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] To compare the different signals, we should maybe try to only take measurements in small motions in the useful are, i.e. around the equilibrium position.
  \item[-] Kalman filter is a way to optimize all this data combination and filtering, but it is out of scope for this semester.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Motor and Motor Controller Board}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] Try to make an experiment to measure the actual current control loop's time constant.
  \item[-] Electrical time constant is not sufficient.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Senstool and Gauss-Newton method}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] The implementation shown during the presentation should be documented along with the method and principles.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design of the Controller}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] We are not sure whether any controller can catch the Cubli with initial condition of 6\si{^{\circ}} and no velocity nor torque.
  \item[-] In simulations, we should put the model in a stable position at first and add a disturbance signal at some point.
  \item[-] It should be easy to calculate how much torque is neeed to catch it with any initial angle.
  \item[-] The velocity(-ies) definitely has(-ve) to be used as feedback along with the position. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discretization and Implementation of the Controller}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] 
  \item[-] 
  \item[-] The paper that we found about cascade control of unstable open loop systems should be sent to the supervisors and maybe used as a reference in the report.
  \item[-] 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] Some of us should investigate the state-space way of representing the system.
  \item[-] Some others should document cascade controller attempts.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Next Supervisor meeting}
Wednesday, 20th of April at 13.00
