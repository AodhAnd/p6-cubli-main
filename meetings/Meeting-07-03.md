# Meeting 07/03

## Linearization
First, see the comments about the bar notation.
Say that the thetaF and its derivative are 0 as well as the angle theta_w. Then the torque results in a 0 torque.
Equation 3.19-21: Sum up what equations the model is made of. 
About Figure 3.4: clarify what we want to show with this diagram
area is more interval


## Verification of Model
It is still a good idea to use this graph of comparison between model and equations.
It is also necessary to compare non-linear with linearized model

## System Test (grouped data points)
Try to do a (rolling) average

Show that kind of things in the report

## Misc.
### Motor model
Use a simple model at first and improve it later, once a controller has been made working.
### Sensor
Same thing: stay with the pot. for the moment
Use some filters ?

## Next meeting
On Monday  at 13.00
