# Potentiometer Resolution (01/04/16)

Put the Cubli in the upright equilibrium position.
Start the recording and swing it to one side and then to the other side.

In potResTest#.csv, a clamp was put on the left dampening pad to eliminate the deadzone of the potmeter from the data by raising the Cubli a little bit.
In potResTestNoClamp, this clamp was removed.
